App Idea:
    Food App is a comprehensive tool designed to help users track the food in their pantry and manage their personal recipe collection. It allows users to log meals and recipes while automatically calculating their macronutrient content. Beyond personal organization, the app features an explore page for discovering new recipes and offers intelligent meal suggestions based on available ingredients. Additionally, Food App includes a unique "version control" system for recipes, enabling users to fork or clone existing recipes, make modifications, and maintain a clear history of contributions while preserving the original creators' ownership.
